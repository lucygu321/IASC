<h3> Paragraphs </h3>
<p>A true friend is one who loves you and appreciates you as you are. There are neither any demands made of you nor any compulsions on you from your true friend. When friendship is all about love, it is a special place in your heart that you reserve for your friend, just as your friend keeps a special place for you in her/his heart. 
In a true friendship there is an unsaid <strong>mutuality and reciprocity</strong>. A friend is one you can be sure of. You have the assurance of a friend’s <em>love and care</em> at all times. And you in turn will always do anything to keep your friendship going strong.</p>
<p>You are my <strong>world</strong>. I’ve honestly fallen <strong><em>deeply in love</strong></em> with you and I am not afraid to say it. We have been through thick and thin and we are still going strong. I can’t imagine my life without you by my side. I love you so much I can’t even explain it!</p>
